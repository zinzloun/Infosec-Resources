# ![Cyb](cyb.png) Cybereason OnPrem API

## Use Case: Retrieve Active MalOps in the Current Week

### Requirements

- Python 3  
- Cybereason root CA certificate (PEM format) â€” required if the Cybereason server uses an internal/private CA  
- The API calling system **must trust** the above certificate

> If you prefer (for testing only), you can skip certificate verification by using `verify=False` in the requests call (instead of `verify=ROOT_CERT_PATH`). **This is strongly discouraged in production** because it disables TLS certificate validation.


This script automates the retrieval of active MalOps for the current week and performs related actions. Specifically, it:

1. Reads configuration parameters from a `.ini` file.  
2. Authenticates to the Cybereason Webserver.  
3. Sends a request to the API endpoint to query active MalOps for the current week.  
4. Sends an email notification if any MalOps are found.  
5. Writes a log file (in `w` mode).  
6. Closes the session.

### Note

Although this information is not documented on the Nest, Cybereason support confirmed:

> "The API call `/rest/detection/inbox` is deprecated, but it still exists in On-Prem API calls."

As a result, this call **may no longer work in future releases** (version > 23.2.307).
